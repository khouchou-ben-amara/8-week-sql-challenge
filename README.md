# 8 Week SQL Challenge

This repository documents my work on the **8 Week SQL Challenge**, a structured
set of real-world SQL case studies designed to progressively build strong
data analysis skills.

The challenge covers a wide range of SQL concepts, from basic aggregations
to more advanced analytical logic, including joins, subqueries, and window
functions.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The objective of this project is to:
- Develop a **solid and realistic understanding of SQL**
- Practice solving **business-driven data problems**
- Learn how to structure complex queries step by step
- Build a **clear, well-documented SQL portfolio** for recruiters

Rather than rushing through the problems, I chose to follow the challenge
at its intended pace in order to fully understand the logic behind each solution.

## 🧠 Learning Approach

Each case study is approached progressively:
- Understanding the business question
- Breaking the problem into smaller logical steps
- Writing readable and maintainable SQL
- Explaining results in plain English

This approach reflects how SQL is used in real professional environments.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each case study folder contains:
- `schema.sql` – database structure
- `questions.md` – original business questions
- `solutions.sql` – SQL queries and solutions
- `insights.md` – business interpretations and reasoning
