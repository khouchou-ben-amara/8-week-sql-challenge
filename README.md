# 8 Week SQL Challenge — 8-Day Intensive Sprint

This repository documents my completion of the **8 Week SQL Challenge**
as an **intensive 8-day sprint**, designed to rapidly strengthen my SQL
skills and build a recruiter-ready portfolio.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to:
- Practice **real-world SQL case studies**
- Strengthen analytical thinking through business-driven questions
- Demonstrate the ability to move from **raw data → SQL → insights**
- Showcase clean, structured, and well-documented SQL work

## ⏱️ Why an 8-Day Challenge?

Instead of spreading the challenge over 8 weeks, I chose an **accelerated
8-day format** to:
- Simulate real-world learning under time constraints
- Improve speed, confidence, and problem-solving efficiency
- Focus on execution, clarity, and results

Each day is dedicated to **one full case study**, including:
- Understanding the business problem
- Writing SQL queries
- Interpreting results and extracting insights

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- SQL joins (INNER, LEFT)
- Aggregations & GROUP BY
- Date logic
- CTEs & window functions
- Data interpretation & business insights
- Clear documentation for stakeholders

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each case study folder contains:
- `schema.sql` – database structure
- `questions.md` – business questions
- `solutions.sql` – SQL queries
- `insights.md` – my personal interpretations
